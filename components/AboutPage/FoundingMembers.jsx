          In 2021, a group of builders, innovators and dreamers realized that
          the world doesn&apos;t just need powerful AI - it needs powerful AI
          that{' '}
          <span className="border-b-4 border-purple-300">
            belongs to everyone
          </span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          So, they envisioned something radical - a truly open network where
          everyone could run, build, own and participate in AI.{' '}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Not just as users, but owners of it.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          They called it Olas â€” crypto&apos;s ocean of agents. And from a small
          DAO of 50, they created{' '}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            one of the very first projects at the intersection of Crypto x AI.

      Today, Olas coordinates the growth of autonomous AI Agents that trade,
      influence, and predict on behalf of their owners. These are already
      creating value through millions of transactions each month
